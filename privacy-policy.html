    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Money Tracker - Simple Expense Manager</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Money Tracker ("we", "us", or "the App") handles information when you use our Android application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Data You Provide</h3>
    <p>The App allows you to enter and manage personal financial data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transaction amounts, dates, and notes</li>
        <li>Income, expense, and transfer details including categories and subcategories</li>
        <li>Account names, types, and balances</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All of this data is stored locally on your device</strong> using an on-device database (Room/SQLite). We do not transmit, collect, or have access to your financial data on any server.</p>

    <h3>1.2 App Preferences</h3>
    <p>The App stores your preferences locally on your device, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display theme (dark or light mode)</li>
        <li>Selected currency</li>
        <li>Premium purchase status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These preferences are stored using Android DataStore and never leave your device.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The App integrates third-party services that may independently collect certain information. See Section 3 for details.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Your locally stored financial data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your transactions, balances, and account summaries</li>
        <li>Generate monthly and yearly expense reports and charts</li>
        <li>Export your data to PDF or Excel files (premium feature) saved to your device</li>
        <li>Create and restore local backup files (premium feature) saved to your device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your financial data for analytics, advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the App's core functionality to you.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>The App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob to non-premium users. AdMob may collect and process certain data in accordance with Google's privacy practices, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General device information (model, OS version, screen size)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and processed by Google, not by us. You can learn more about how Google uses this information in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a> and manage your ad preferences in your device's <strong>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads</strong>.</p>
    <p>Premium users who purchase the upgrade do not see ads, and AdMob does not load for them.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Google Play Billing</h3>
    <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase ("Premium Unlock") processed through Google Play Billing. All purchase transactions are handled entirely by Google Play. We do not collect or store any payment information such as credit card numbers or billing addresses. Purchase status is stored locally on your device.</p>
    <p>For more information, see the <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local storage only:</strong> All your financial data, categories, accounts, and preferences are stored exclusively on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>No cloud sync:</strong> The App does not upload your data to any cloud service or remote server.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup files:</strong> When you use the backup feature, a JSON file is saved to a location you choose on your device. You are responsible for the security of exported and backup files.</li>
        <li><strong>No account required:</strong> The App does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or sign in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not use cookies or tracking technologies. However, Google AdMob (for non-premium users) may use advertising identifiers and similar technologies to serve and measure ads. These are managed by Google and subject to Google's policies.</p>
    <p>The App does not use any analytics SDKs (such as Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics) and does not track your usage behavior.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your personal or financial data with any third party. The only data that leaves your device is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information collected by Google AdMob for ad serving (non-premium users only)</li>
        <li>Purchase verification data handled by Google Play Billing</li>
        <li>Standard network requests required for the above services (requiring INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is a general-purpose financial management tool intended for use by adults and older teens who manage their own finances.</p>
    <p>If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> You can delete all your data at any time by clearing the App's data in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Premium users can export their financial data to PDF or Excel format.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out of personalized ads:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's ad settings (<strong>Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</strong>).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove ads entirely:</strong> Purchase the Premium Unlock to remove all advertisements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following Android permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required for loading advertisements (AdMob) and processing in-app purchases (Google Play Billing).</li>
        <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used to check network availability before loading ads.</li>
        <li><strong>BILLING:</strong> Required for processing in-app purchases through Google Play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
